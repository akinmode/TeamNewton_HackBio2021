<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to Team-Newton</h1>
<p align="center">Team Repository for the HackBio Internship 2021 (Stage 0)</p>
<p>The HackBio Internship is a 5-weeks virtually regimented research internship that is practice oriented, and focused on equipping life scientists with advanced bioinformatics and computational biology skills. Successful interns advance their skills in a specific bioinformatics method and are driven to communicate their progress in a peer-reviewed article to show for the internship experience.
The internship is absolutely cost-free, and no exam or interview is required. It is open to all and does not require expertise to be successful; even complete novices can be successful, provided they are ready to learn.</p>

<p>Team-Newton consists of 20 members of diverse academic background and bioinformatic expertise, for the HackBio Internship 2021.</p>
<p>Team members include:
